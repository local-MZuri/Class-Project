    <h1 id="head">ABOUT US</h1>
    <h3>Project Illuminare grew from a mere reflection to a raging 
        advocacy that will inspire millions.</h3>
    <p id="desc">One day, a group of friends were acting up, and suddenly, a teacher reprimanded them. That teacher told them, 
        "Don't you consider the privilege of education you are in?". 
        The group went silent, it may be simple words, but it held deep within them. This gave them space to ponder, 
        and slowly, they were building up a common thought that the educational situation is not at its best state, 
        not only locally, but also worldwide. Looking at our classmates, we realized how blessed we were, but we also 
        saw the sad reality that some are not able to have quality education because of different reasonsâ€”resources, 
        personal matters, and many more. <br><br> 
        Illuminare is an Italian word that means to enlight, and we want to share this 
        light to spark others for who they are meant to be. We want to illuminate minds, and furthermore futures.<br><br>
        Through this project, we aim to connect acquaintances, peers, teachers, friends, family, and whoever there 
        may be through a commitment: unity in the name of education. One's light could also illuminate the world.</p>

            I am Zuriel Jayce Denosta, a PSHS-SMC scholar from Batch 2029. I started this vision for us to help seek value in 
            education. Growing up, I was blessed enough to have quality education at the palm of my hands, but part of me 
            always wondered about those who weren't as fortunate as I was. This made me realize how important education is, 
            and how it can shape one's future.

        <p id="desc2">
            With this, I wanted to create a platform where we can all come together and 
            advocate for quality education for everyone. Through Project Illuminare, I hope to inspire others to see the 
            significance of education and to work towards making it accessible for all.
